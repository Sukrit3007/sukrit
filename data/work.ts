    description: "The current methods for purchasing university merchandise lack convenience, accessibility, and inclusivity. Traditional stores may not offer enough variety and may not be easily accessible for off-campus students or alumni. Furthermore, the absence of an online store misses opportunities for community engagement and revenue generation. Existing ecommerce platforms don't cater to the unique needs of university members and lack personalized experiences. Additionally, the lack of secure online payment options hinders purchases, leading to missed revenue. To address these issues, a comprehensive ecommerce website tailored for university merchandise is needed, offering accessibility, online presence, user-friendly experience, and secure payments to enhance community engagement and revenue growth.",
